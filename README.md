disco-sort
=========

Introduction:
------------

disco-sort is a simple sorting algorithm visualiser using the pygame and pygame-menu libraries.  I wrote this program to learn some new things and beef up my programming skills/knowledge.  

I hope someone finds something useful/fun/interesting here.  Feel free to use this code in any way you like, and if you have any constructive feedback about things I could have done better I am all ears.  I feel like I learned quite a bit with this project and I look forward to the next! 


Install Instructions:
--------------------

This relies on pygame: https://github.com/pygame/pygame

and pygame-menu: https://github.com/ppizarror/pygame-menu

So be sure to have both those. 
After that you should just be able to run it from the command line with:

    $> python disco-sort.py
    
    
To do:
-----
 - check docstrings and comments
 - add descriptions at beginning of modules
 - add ui elements while sorting
 - add vicory animation
 - add insertion sort
